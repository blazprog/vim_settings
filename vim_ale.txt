Unfortunately, this makes the location list pop up as soon as an error appears while 
I'm typing, which is rather distracting. Is there some way to have it show up only 
when I save, or something like that?

That's called a location list. See :h location-list. I never used ALE, but I bet it has 
either location list or quickfix list support.

To add, ALE pops up the location list if you save with errors, like Syntastic does by default. 
You could just open the location list while you type, but I'm not sure
