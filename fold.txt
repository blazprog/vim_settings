The fold command can wrap lines.

fold – wrap each input line to fit in specified width

For your purpose,

fold -w 80 -s in.txt > out.txt

fold has more options, you may check

-b, –bytes
count bytes rather than columns


-s, –spaces
break at spaces

-w, –width=WIDTH
use WIDTH columns instead of 80
